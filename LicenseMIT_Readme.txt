I created some JavaFX projects, a GraphicsUtilityLibrary I am working on and a FileUtilityLibrary that includes code for generating Support Amps, Critical Thinking Amps, and Story Outlines on GitHub

Several of the projects are a work in progress and are set to --enable-preview with the Java 19 features

Also a notable app for Flashcards Definitions and for Increasing Typing Throughput
